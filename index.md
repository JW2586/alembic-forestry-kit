**The South Hams Society**, an environmental and heritage charity, was founded in 1961 to protect the natural landscape and the built character of the South Hams, and particularly of the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Society aims to encourage high standards of planning and architecture which respect the special character of the area and that fosters a healthy biodiversity. The Society is a supporter of the right development – in the right places – and actively opposes inappropriate and harmful development.
